🚀 Project Milestone: Data Analysis Project – ML & Gen AI Bootcamp 🧠💡
Over the past few weeks, I had the incredible opportunity to work on a real-world data analysis project as part of the Machine Learning and Generative AI Bootcamp, mentored by Monal Sir 🙌.

🔍 Project Overview:
 OffBeat Destinations is a third-party booking platform offering unique holiday stays—apartments, villas, lofts—tailored to customer preferences. My task was to analyze booking trends and generate personalized reports for customers based on their selections.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Language: Python
Backend: MongoDB Atlas Cluster
Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Concepts: OOPs, Data Visualization, Filtering, User Interaction

📊 From building a smooth user journey to generating insightful PDF reports, this project deepened my understanding of backend integration, data engineering, and interactive analysis—all aligned with real business use cases!

🔧 Problem Statement
Objective:
Design and implement a scalable data analysis pipeline for OffBeat Destinations, a third-party holiday booking platform, to process and analyze rental listings based on user preferences, and generate personalized insight reports to aid customer booking decisions.

Key Challenges:

Ingest semi-structured property listing data from a MongoDB backend server

Enable user-driven selection (e.g., city, property type, price range, rating) via an interactive CLI interface

Clean, filter, and analyze the data using pandas and custom logic

Visualize booking trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Dynamically generate multi-page PDF reports containing charts and filtered tabular data personalized to user selections

Implement end-to-end flow using object-oriented Python design principles
